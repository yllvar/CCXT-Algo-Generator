# LangChain CCXT Code Generator and Deployment on Vercel

## Overview

This project implements a cryptocurrency trading algorithm code generator using LangChain, an AI-powered language model from OpenAI, and the CCXT library for cryptocurrency exchange integration. The code generator takes user input describing their trading task and generates Python code tailored to the specified requirements.

The generated code includes functionalities such as fetching market data, placing orders, and implementing trading strategies using the CCXT library. Additionally, the code is annotated to explain each line's role in the overall strategy, ensuring clarity and understanding.

The generated code can be further customized and improved based on user feedback and iterative interactions with the language model.
